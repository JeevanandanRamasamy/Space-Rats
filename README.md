# Space Rats: Bot Strategy Comparison and Neural Network Training

This repository contains a Python implementation for testing bot strategies in the Space Rats game and training a deep learning model to predict the number of turns left based on the bot's environment. The project consists of two main parts:

1. **Bot Strategy Testing**: Compare different bot strategies and analyze how they perform across multiple iterations for different alpha values.
2. **Neural Network Training**: Train a neural network model using the collected game data to predict the number of turns left based on bot locations and knowledge bases.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
This project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `tqdm`
- `sklearn`
- `torch`
- `space_rats` (custom game environment module)

You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tqdm sklearn torch
```

## Cloning the Repository

To clone this repository, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JeevanandanRamasamy/space-rats.git
cd space-rats
```

## Bot Strategy Testing

The `test_bots` function tests two bot strategies and compares their performance based on the number of turns taken in the Space Rats game. The strategies can be specified as `stationary` or `mobile`.

### Overview of test_bots

1. **Input**:
   - Grid size (`D`)
   - Learning rate (`alpha`)
   - Number of iterations (`iterations`)
   - Strategy (`space_rat_strategy`), either `stationary` or `mobile`.
   - Random seed for reproducibility.
2. **Functionality**:
   - Initializes the game with the specified parameters.
   - Runs both bots with parallelized processing using `ProcessPoolExecutor`.
   - Computes and returns the number of turns taken by each bot for each iteration.
3. **Output**:
   - Returns two lists containing the number of turns taken by each bot.

### plot_turn_counts

This function plots the average number of turns taken by both bots for different alpha values. The plot is generated using `matplotlib` and provides a visual comparison between the bot strategies.

**Example Usage**
```python
dim, iter = 30, 100
bot1_average_list, bot2_average_list = [], []
alpha_values = [0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.12, 0.14, 0.16, 0.18, 0.2,
                0.22, 0.24, 0.26, 0.28, 0.3, 0.32, 0.34, 0.36, 0.38, 0.4]
for alpha in alpha_values:
    print("Alpha value:", alpha)
    bot1_turns, bot2_turns = test_bots(D=dim, alpha=alpha, iterations=iter, space_rat_strategy='mobile')
    bot1_average_list.append(sum(bot1_turns) / iter)
    bot2_average_list.append(sum(bot2_turns) / iter)
plot_turn_counts(alpha_values, bot1_average_list, bot2_average_list)
```

## Neural Network Training

This section trains a neural network model using the data generated from the Space Rats game. The model is designed to predict the number of turns left in the game based on the botâ€™s environment.

### Data Preprocessing

Data is collected and transformed into a format suitable for training the neural network. The dataset includes:
- `bot_locations`: 2D array representing the positions of the bots.
- `knowledge_bases`: 2D array representing the knowledge of each bot at a specific grid location.
- `num_turns_left`: The number of turns left in the game for each state.

### Model Architecture

The neural network is a CNN-based model that processes the bot locations and knowledge bases. The architecture consists of:
1. **Convolutional Layers**:
   - Two convolutional layers with Batch Normalization for better training stability.
   - Activation function: ReLU.
2. **Global Pooling**:
   - Adaptive Average Pooling is used to reduce the feature map to a single value.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**:
   - Two fully connected layers for feature transformation.
   - Dropout layer to prevent overfitting.
4. **Output Layer**:
   - A single output representing the predicted number of turns left.

**Example**
```python
train_net(data, learning_rate=0.001, num_epochs=20, batch_size=64)
```

### Training

- The dataset is split into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%).
- The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and the Smooth L1 loss function.
- The best model is saved based on the lowest validation loss.

### Evaluation

The model is evaluated on the test set, and a scatter plot is generated comparing the predicted number of turns left with the actual values.
```python
evaluate_and_plot(model, test_loader, criterion)
```

## Results

The primary output of this project is the comparison of bot strategies and the performance of the trained neural network.
1. Bot Strategy Comparison:
   - A plot comparing the number of turns taken by both bots for various alpha values is generated.
   - The bot strategies are tested over multiple iterations to assess their performance.
2. Model Evaluation:
   - The model is evaluated on the test set, and a scatter plot is generated to compare predicted vs actual values for the number of turns left.

## Usage

To run the entire pipeline (bot testing and neural network training), simply execute the train_net function after loading the data:
```python
# Ensure the data file is in the same directory as the script
data = load_data(filename="space_rats_simulation_data.npz", iterations=7500, strat='stationary')
plot_visual(data)
train_net(data, learning_rate=0.001, num_epochs=20, batch_size=64)
```
